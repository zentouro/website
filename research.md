<!-- Content -->
<p>I study compound hydrological extremes as a PhD student in Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia University. I'm interested in how severe hazards will change under warming and the vulnerability of people and ecosystems to these changes. </p>

		<h3>Drought Termination</h3>
		<p>At the intersection of drought and precipitation extremes is drought termination. Investigating the interplay between extreme precipitation and droughts, as compound events, is necessary to understand the physical processes that drive changes in these events and improve our ability to assess future impacts and risks. Like many compound events, drought termination is less well understood than its constituent components. I use large global climate model ensembles, experiments with the NASA GISS climate model, and observations to investigate how changes in precipitation affect drought termination in the context of future warming. </p>
