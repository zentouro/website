					Climate change can be complicated, but getting answers shouldn't be. On zentouro, we talk about climate change, the environment, and how we can create a better future for everyone. 
					The videos cover everything from wonky policy moonshots, to pipeline protests, and how to deal with eco-anxiety. The channel aims to communicate climate and environmental stories that go beyond the headlines and create a supportive, energized digital space for anyone concerned and activated in the climate crisis.
